# Annotation Workspace Refactoring

## Overview
The AnnotationWorkspace.tsx file has been refactored from a monolithic 1446-line component into a modular, feature-sliced design architecture. Originally split into separate annotation-tools and annotation-list features, they have been unified into a single annotation feature for better cohesion.

## New Structure

### Features
- **annotation**: Unified annotation functionality
  - `AnnotationToolSelector`: Tool selection UI
  - `ToolConfigPanel`: Dynamic configuration panel for each tool
  - `AnnotationListPanel`: Right panel for annotation list
  - `AnnotationItem`: Individual annotation display
  - `useAnnotationTools`: Tool logic and constraints

- **workspace-controls**: View and workspace controls
  - `ViewControls`: Zoom, pan, reset controls
  - `WorkspaceStatusBar`: Bottom status bar with tool info
  - `useViewControls`: View manipulation logic

- **image-navigation**: Image navigation functionality
  - `ImageNavigationPanel`: Compact navigation sidebar
  - `useImageNavigation`: Navigation logic and state

### Widgets
- **annotation-sidebar**: Composed sidebar widget combining tools, config, and controls

### Benefits
1. **Modularity**: Each feature is self-contained and reusable
2. **Maintainability**: Smaller, focused components are easier to maintain
3. **Testability**: Individual features can be tested in isolation
4. **Scalability**: New features can be added without affecting existing code
5. **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript interfaces for all components

### Usage
```tsx
import { AnnotationWorkspaceRefactored } from '@/pages/AnnotationWorkspaceRefactored';

// Use the refactored component instead of the original
<AnnotationWorkspaceRefactored />
```

### Migration
The original `AnnotationWorkspace.tsx` remains unchanged for backward compatibility. The new refactored version is available as `AnnotationWorkspaceRefactored.tsx`.

To migrate:
1. Replace imports to use the refactored version
2. Test all functionality works as expected
3. Remove the original file when confident in the refactored version
